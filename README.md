# SIS_Project
This is a coding assignment for SIS using basketball data. It answers
several questions and outputs the answers CSV files (or a PNG for the last question).
No data transformations were made, but a couple of variables were added to the data set:
 * PLAYOFFS - identifies whether the game was not a playoff game or not:
   * No - regular season game
   * None - play-in tournament (these games were not used)
   * Yes - playoff game
 * ALL_STAR_BREAK - identifies if the game took place before or after the All Star Break
